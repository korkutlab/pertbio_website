    <h4>Model execution with in silico perturbations</h4>
    <div class="main-paragraph">
        Thanks to their ODE-based mathematical descriptions, the models can be executed
        to predict cellular response to novel perturbations. The systematic predictions
        go beyond the analysis of few particular edges in the system and capture the
        collective signaling mechanisms of response to drugs. We execute the parameterized
        model ODEs with in silico perturbations acting on node (i) as a real numbered u(i)
        value until all the system variables (i.e. node values, {x<sub>i</sub>}) reach to
        steady state. The simulations expand the size of the response map by three orders
        of magnitude from few thousand experimental response data to millions of
        predicted responses.
